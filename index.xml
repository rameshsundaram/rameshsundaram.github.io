      <description>A few weeks (er, maybe months) ago, Atlanta Tableau User Group (ATUG) announced a visualization contest. We, a core team of 3 from Moxie (Zack, John and myself) entered and we won. We also won tickets on the 15th row for the Tom Petty concert in Atlanta, and just a little bit of extra data viz street cred.
Proud! And very thrilled!! But more importantly, we learned a few things along the way.</description>

      <description>As a Data Science and Analytics leader, I believe in the impact of decisions driven by rigorous strategic analytics.
I have demonstrated experience in strategy development using appropriate analytical methods for Fortune 500 companies. To accomplish that, I lean on careful problem framing, develop critical questions, answer those using the best measurements and communicate precisely using a suitable instrument. In all the above, I lead by example, partner with cross-functional teams, leverage critical talent across the organization to advance goals while evolving internal capabilities.</description>
